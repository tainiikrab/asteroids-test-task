# Asteroids
<p>
A classic <b>Asteroids</b> arcade game recreated with Unity using an ECS-based architecture powered by Leopotam ECS.
</p>
<p>
The project focuses on clean separation between gameplay logic and the Unity presentation layer, keeping the core systems modular, testable, and engine-agnostic.
</p>
<p>
Game includes inertia-based ship movement, asteroid splitting, homing saucers, laser and bullet weapons, and seamless screen wrapping.
